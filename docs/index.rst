Slam Documentation
==================

Slam is a simple command-line utility that makes it very easy to do serverless
deployments of Python web applications to AWS, using the `Lambda
<https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ and `API Gateway
<https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>`_ services. In particular, Slam supports
the transparent deployment of `WSGI <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_
compliant applications.
